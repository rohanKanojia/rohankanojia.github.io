Currently working at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) to improve the experience of Java developers on top of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). If you are a Java developer trying to move projects to  [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) / [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) you may find my projects useful.
