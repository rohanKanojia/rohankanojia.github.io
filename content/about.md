## Quick Bio

I'm quite fortunate to have had an opportunity to work for [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en), one of the leading Open Source companies globally. For its many advantages, I'm very inclined to continue working with and promoting the use of Free and Open Source Softwares.

I'm also an [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/) commiter for [Eclipse JKube](https://github.com/eclipse/jkube) project. I have previously worked as a Java developer for a Bengaluru based startup [MoveInSync](https://moveinsync.com/).

I'm part of three great free open source projects:
- [Eclipse JKube](https://github.com/eclipse/jkube)
- [Fabric8 Kubernetes Java Client](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client)
- [Fabric8 Docker Maven Plugin](https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin)

When not in front of computer, I like to go for walks and ride my bicycle.
